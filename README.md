TODO:
- ~~migrate to the `var App = {}` structure with namespacing~~
- ~~remove model if edit field is empty~~
- ~~rewrite editing logic with CSS help~~
- ~~make click on LI switches to edit mode~~

Maybe:
- ~~use package.json for `npm i` and `npm start`~~
- ~~migrate to Mustache templates~~
- use bootstrap data with page sended
- add localStorage (write custom Model.sync)
- use http://documentup.com/jeromegn/backbone.localStorage


- Express
  - Morgan
  - routes
- jQuery
  - Mustache

  - Mustache (was Underscore)

```
> git clone && cd
> npm install
> npm start
```
- `npm run jquery` opens `http://localhost:3000/jq/`
- `npm run backbone` opens `http://localhost:3000/b/`

Use `HTTPie` (`brew install httpie`) for REST API testing.
